# NLP Assignments – Text Processing & Sentiment Analysis
The assignments cover the complete text preprocessing pipeline and the implementation of a basic sentiment analysis model using machine learning.

## Assignment 1 — NLP Preprocessing Pipeline 

*This assignment focuses on transforming raw text into a clean, machine-readable format.
A custom paragraph is processed step by step using core NLP techniques.*

##### *🔹 Steps Covered*
*1. Tokenization*

*Splitting text into smaller units (words).*

*2. Stopword Removal*

*Removing common words that do not add much meaning (like “is”, “the”, “in”).*

*3. Stemming*

*Reducing words to root forms by removing prefixes/suffixes.
Example: playing → play, studies → studi*

*4. Lemmatization
Converting words to meaningful dictionary base forms using grammar rules.
Example: studies → study, better → good*

##### *🔹 Goal*

*To understand how text is cleaned and prepared before applying any NLP or ML model.*

## Assignment 2 — Sentiment Analysis using ML + NLP

*This assignment builds a simple sentiment classification model.
A small dataset (positive + negative text) is created from different styles of sources.*

##### *🔹 Steps Covered*

*1. Data Collection*

*Sample text from social media, reviews, and general feedback.*

*2. Text Cleaning*

*Lowercasing and removing unwanted spaces.*

*3. TF-IDF Vectorization*

*Converting text into numerical vectors based on word importance.*

*4. Model Training*

*Logistic Regression is used to classify text as
Positive,
Negative*

*5. Model Evaluation*

*Accuracy score and classification report are generated.*

*6. Custom Predictions*

*Testing the model on new sentences.*

##### *🔹 Goal*

*To learn how machine learning and NLP work together to classify real-world text*

##### *Technologies Used*

*1. Python*

*2. NLTK*

*3. Pandas, NumPy*

*4. Scikit-Learn*

*5. Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook*

#### Conclusion

Both assignments help build a strong foundation in NLP.
Assignment 1 explains how raw text is cleaned and transformed, while Assignment 2 shows how that processed text can be used to train a sentiment analysis model. Together, they demonstrate the full journey from preprocessing to prediction.
